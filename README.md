GAME RULES
Gameplay (Face-Off)
• Teams will be assembled at random from those indicating a desire to participate.
• One player from each team approaches the center, with one hand behind their backs
and the other flat on the table, ready to buzz in.
• The question is read once and stops at the first buzz in. The question may be re-read
after the first player to buzz in makes their guess.
• If the first player who buzzed in reveals an answer that isn’t number 1, then the other
player has a chance to guess an answer.
• First to buzz in and provide an answer that is revealed highest ranking on the board can
choose for their team to pass, or play.
• If neither player is able to make any correct guesses during the face-off, then play goes
to the second player of the team of the first player who buzzed in, and continues to
alternate between teams until a correct answer is given.
Gameplay (Continued)
• After a team has chosen to pass or play, the playing team must guess the remaining
answers on the board.
• Players on the team answer one at a time, within 10 seconds of hearing the question,
with no help from their other teammates. If a player incorrectly guesses or doesn’t
provide a guess in time, the team receives a strike.
• When a team reaches 3 strikes, the opposing team has a chance to steal the board. The
opposing team can work together to quickly come up with an answer.
• If the opposing team reveals one of the remaining answers on the board, the opposing
team steals all the revealed points for that round.
• If the opposing team is unable to reveal an answer on the board, the playing team keeps
the points they’ve earned and the round is over. The remaining answers are revealed.
The method by which the winning team will be determined will be announced just prior to the
start of the game
